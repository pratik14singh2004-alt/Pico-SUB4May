## 2026-03-22

### Sidebar Redesign
- Replaced "GLOBAL" header text with a row of quick-access shortcut icons: Matrix Mixer, Settings, Loudness Compensation, Crossfeed, Stats for Nerbs, and Bypass Master EQ
- Icons illuminate when their feature is active (window open or feature enabled)
- Bypass icon turns red when engaged
- Hover over an icon produces a subtle brightness increase with ease-in/out animation
- Matrix Mixer and Stats icons now toggle their windows open/closed on click
- Loudness Compensation and Crossfeed: left-click toggles on/off, right-click opens settings window
- Removed the standalone "Bypass Master EQ" toggle button

### Multi-Device Support
- App now discovers and tracks all connected DSPi devices by serial number
- Device selector in the sidebar footer shows the active device name with a dropdown chevron
- When multiple devices are connected, clicking the selector opens a flyout to switch between them
- Current device indicated with a checkmark in the flyout
- Switching devices with unsaved preset changes prompts a Save/Discard/Cancel dialog
- Auto-reconnects to the previously selected device if it is unplugged and re-plugged
- Auto-selects the first device if none is currently selected

### Connection Status
- Moved connection status to the sidebar footer alongside the CPU meter
- Connection indicator dot and device name shown inline
- Right-click the connection area to trigger a reconnect
- Removed the standalone reconnect button
- "Connected" text replaced with the active device display name (e.g. "DSPi (A1B2C3D4)")

### Title Bar
- Moved the menu button to the left side of the title bar
- Changed the menu icon from a gear to a hamburger menu icon

### Preset Selector
- Removed "(empty)" suffix from unoccupied preset slots
- Preset ComboBox is now transparent by default, border appears on hover
- Preset text color matched to channel name color for consistency

### Theming
- CPU meter bar, connection indicator dot, preamp slider track, and slider thumb now use the Windows system accent color
- CPU meter still turns red when load exceeds 90%; connection dot turns red when disconnected

### Layout Polish
- CPU meter and connection status consolidated into a single compact footer row
- Increased bottom row element sizes slightly for better readability (font 11, meter bar 44x6)
- Reduced gap between shortcut icon row and system status section
- Device selector box shows a subtle rounded highlight on hover
